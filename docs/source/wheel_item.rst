Introduction
============

**WheelItem** is a dataclass to simplify handling of colorwheel definitions. The structure of data closely mirrors YAML definition file(s) used to define colors.

A Wheel Item simply contains a named RGB color sequence.

Naming the sequence is used for easy switching of colorwheels, while the list of colors is a list of ColorItem objects. See :doc:`color_item` for more information.
