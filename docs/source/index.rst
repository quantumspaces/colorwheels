ColorWheels - An Endless Color Generator
========================================

This project is a continuous color generator for Python. We create a palette of a specific color range, a palette of matching colors and similar to serve to a consumer application. Serves perfectly for generating rainbow effects in hobby electronics (RGB LEDs, RGB Panels), and elsewhere. The idea behind is an endless colorwheel for photographers - the wheel continuously turns around to generate the next color.
